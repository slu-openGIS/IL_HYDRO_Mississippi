  * **Source:** Created from the 2016 Census TIGER area water shapefile for Madison and St. Clair counties, Illinois.
  * **Modifications:** Both county area water shapefiles were edited so that only the Mississippi River features remained. The extent of these features in both counties was edited so that they matched the length of the St. Louis City, Missouri area water shapefile. The features from Madison and St. Clair counties were then merged into a single shapefile.
