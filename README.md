### Abstract
The Census TIGER hydrology data is released by county, so bodies of water that lie between jurisdictions end up split. This shapefile contains data on the extent of the Mississippi River in Madison and St. Clair counties for the length of the City of St. Louis. These data can be previewed interactively using the [`.geoJSON` file in this repository](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/IL_HYDRO_Mississippi/blob/master/geoJSON/IL_HYDRO_Mississippi.geoJSON).

### Use with R
The [`gateway` package](https://github.com/slu-openGIS/gateway) can be used to download and import these data as a simple feature object:

```r
city <- gateway::gw_get_repo("IL_HYDRO_Mississippi")
```
